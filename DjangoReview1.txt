Django Review Exercise 1 
========================
Open 'polls/models.py' and declare a model for 'weather'
This should include 'city', 'country' and 'description' as character fields
Also include 'temperature' as a FloatField (with a sensible default value)
Write a new __str__ method for this data model, which returns the city, description and temperature

Make migrations and migrate

Open 'polls/admin.py' and import your Weather model
Register your Weather model with the admin site (exactly as for 'Question' and 'Choice')

Open the admin site and add a few weather reports
(Notice that new 'Weather' instances use your __str__ in the Admin interface)

Open 'polls/views.py' and declare a view called 'weather' descended from 'base.html'
Return some content for this view from the weather model
Open 'polls/urls.py' and add a path 'weather/' which leads to this new view
Check your view content gets rendered in the browser when you navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/polls/weather/

Optional
========
Add more data members to the weather model e.g. wind speed and direction etc.
Create a weather_detail page which shows details for a selected weather member
Link the weather list to the weather detail, passing a context dictionary
Remember the 'temperature' field should be type='number'
(NB this is NOT as complex as the 'votes' system)
